# InstallShield Options File
#
# Wizard name: Install
# Wizard source: setup.jar
#
# This file can be used to configure Install with the options specified below
# when the wizard is run with the "-options" command line option. Read each
# setting's documentation for information on how to change its value.
# Please enclose all values within a single pair of double quotes.
# 
# A common use of an options file is to run the wizard in silent mode. This lets
# the options file author specify wizard settings without having to run the
# wizard in graphical or console mode. To use this options file for silent mode
# execution, use the following command line arguments when running the wizard:
# 
#    -options "D:\UpdateInstaller\responsefile.updiinstaller.txt" -silent
