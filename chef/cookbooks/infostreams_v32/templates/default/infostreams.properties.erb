# InfoSphere Streams sample install response file
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# The sample response file for InfoSphere Streams contains values for
# all installation options.
#
# -- A response file is required if you use the silent installation
#    method. For a silent uninstallation, a response file is not
#    supported.
#
# -- A response file is optional if you use the interactive GUI or console
#    method to install Streams.
#
# After you start the install, the InfoSphere Streams install utility
# automatically checks the Streams working directory for a response
# file with either of the following names:
#
# -- installer.properties
# -- InfoSphereStreamsSetup.properties
#
# You can give your response file a different name. However, when
# you invoke the Streams installation command, you must qualify your
# response file with the -f option, for example:
#
#   ./InfoSphereStreamsSetup.bin -i silent -f scenario1.properties
#
# If a response file property is not listed in the response file,
# the Streams install utility uses the default value, if applicable.
#
# Attention: The Streams install utility reads the response file
#            even if the utility is not running in silent mode.
#            If the install utility is running in interactive mode,
#            the utility uses the values in the response file for
#            the defaults on the interactive install panels.
#
#
# Response File Version:
# --------------------------
# The RESPONSE_FILE_VERSION property specifies the version of this response
# file. This value is set when shipped and should never be changed. If this
# value does not match the version the installer is expecting the install
# could fail.
RESPONSE_FILE_VERSION=2.1
#
# Installer locale:
# --------------------------
# The INSTALLER_LOCALE property specifies the locale that will be used
# to write to the install log.  The default locale is en for English.
#
# To set the locale to a different value than the default,
# uncomment the INSTALLER_LOCALE property.
#
#
# Values:
#     en          - (Default) English
#     fr          - French
#     fr_CA       - French (Canadian)
#     ja      - Japanese
#     zh_CN   - Chinese (Simplified)
#     pt_BR   - Portuguese (Brazil)
#     ru      - Russian
#
INSTALLER_LOCALE=en
#
# Install mode and interface:
# --------------------------
# The INSTALLER_UI property specifies the install mode and interface.
# The default mode for installing Streams is interactive, and the
# default interface is an interactive graphical user interface.
#
# To perform a silent install of Streams without human interaction,
# uncomment the INSTALLER_UI property.
#
# Tip:  You can force a silent install by including the -i silent
#       option on the install command, for example:
#       ./InfoSphereStreamsSetup.bin -i silent
#
# Values:
#     swing   - (Default) Run the install in interactive mode
#               with an graphical user interface. This requires
#               an X Window System to launch the installer.
#     console - Run the install in interactive mode with a console
#               interface.
#     silent  - Run the install in silent mode, without any
#               human interaction.
#
# INSTALLER_UI=silent
#
#
# Owner of Streams installed files:
# --------------------------------
# The FILE_OWNER_GROUP identifies the group for the installed files
# in the Streams instance. The default group is streamsadmin.
#
# The FILE_OWNER_USER_ID identifies the user who will own the installed
# files. The default user ID is streamsadmin.
#
# Restriction: A user with root authority cannot own the
#              installed files.
#
# These properties apply only to installations that are run by a user
# with root authority.
#
# -- If the user performing the install has root authority,
#    this user ID is used for both silent and interactive installs.
#
# -- For an interactive install, this user ID is the default on the
#    Specify File Owner panel.
#
# If you want to share the installation with other users, it is
# recommended that you specify an administrator user ID to own
# recommended that you specify an administrator user ID to own
# the installed files.  This ID must be created before you run
# the install utility. The home directory of the user to own the
# installation files must be in a shared file system.
#
# Values:
#   FILE_OWNER_GROUP can be any existing group ID.
#   FILE_OWNER_USER_ID can be any existing user ID.
#
#
FILE_OWNER_GROUP=streamsadmin
FILE_OWNER_USER_ID=streamsadmin
#
#
# Install directory:
# -----------------
# The USER_INSTALL_DIR property is the directory where InfoSphere
# Streams will be installed.
#
# If this property is not specified, the install utility uses the default
# install directory.
#
# The default install directory depends on the authority of the user
# performing the install:
#
# -- If the user has root authority, the default install
#    directory is /opt/ibm/InfoSphereStreams.
#
# -- If the user does not have root authority, the default
#    install directory is <user_home_directory>/InfoSphereStreams.
#
# Important:  If you intend to use the Streams installation in a multiple-host
#             environment, you must either install into a shared file system
#             that is available to each host or install Streams in the same
#             directory path on each host.
#
# For an interactive install, if the USER_INSTALL_DIR property is
# specified, the value of USER_INSTALL_DIR will be the default install
# directory on the Choose Install Folder panel.
#
# Restrictions for USER_INSTALL_DIR:
#     * A valid absolute path.
#     * The directory cannot spaces or certain special characters. See the IBM
#       InfoSphere Streams: Installation and Administration Guide for
#       the list of special characters that are not allowed.
#     * The user performing the install must be authorized to write to the specified
#       directory.
#
# To override the default install directory, uncomment
# this property and enter the desired absolute path. Read, write, and execute
# permissions are required for all existing directories in the specified path.
#
#USER_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/ibm/InfoSphereStreams

#
#

#            will not complete.
